See API docs for publicly accessible props.

Eleveate to higher position:
  Local, Remote, and Distributed Caches

connection name vs pool name

General steps:

- Start w/ cacheFactory , create a cache

- From the cache Get a poolFactory, configure, create a pool

- From the cache, create a regionFactory (incl type of region), configure (incl reference to pool), create a region

- operate on region
(cf C++ examples for simple version)
