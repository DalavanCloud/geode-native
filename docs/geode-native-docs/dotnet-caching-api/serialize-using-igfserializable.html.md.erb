title:  Serialize with the Geode IGFSerializable Interface
---

The .NET `IGFSerializable` interface provides fast and compact data serialization.

-   **[Generic and Custom Serializable Types](serializable-types.html)**

    All built-in generics are automatically registered at initialization. You have a couple of options for complex key types.

-   **[How Serialization Works with IGFSerializable](how-igfserializable-works.html)**

    When your application puts an object into the cache for distribution, Geode serializes the data by taking these steps.

-   **[Implement the IGFSerializable Interface](implementing-igfserializable.html)**

    To store your own data types in the cache, you implement the Geode `IGFSerializable` interface.

-   **[Register the Type](registering-the-type.html)**

    To use the `BankAccount` type, you must register it with the type system. Then, when an incoming stream contains a `BankAccount`, it can be manufactured from the associated `TypeFactoryMethod.`
