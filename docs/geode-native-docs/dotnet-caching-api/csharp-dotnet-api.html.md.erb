The Microsoft .NET Framework interface for the Apache Geode native client provides complete access to the native client C++ functionality from any .NET Framework language (C\#, C++/CLI, VB.NET, and J\#). This enables clients using C\# and other .NET languages to use the capabilities provided by the Geode C++ API.

The Geode native client uses a set of assemblies managed by the C++ Common Language Infrastructure (C++ CLI). C++ CLI includes the libraries and objects necessary for common language types, and it is the framework for .NET applications.

The .NET API for the native client adds .NET Framework CLI language binding for the Geode native client product.

Using C\#, you can write callbacks and define user objects in the cache. The following figure shows an overview of how a C\# application accesses the native client C++ API functionality through C++/CLI .

**Note:**
This chapter uses C\# as the reference language, but other .NET languages work the same way.

The Geode .NET API is provided in the `GemStone::GemFire::Cache::Generic` namespace. This namespace allows you to manage your cache, regions, and data using the .NET Generics APIs.

Use the Geode .NET API to programmatically create, populate, and manage a Geode distributed system.

**Note:**
The .NET library is thread-safe except where otherwise indicated in the API documentation.

For complete information on the APIs, see the .NET API documentation at [http://gemfire-apis.docs.pivotal.io](http://gemfire-apis.docs.pivotal.io). For general information on .NET, see the Microsoft developerâ€™s network website.
