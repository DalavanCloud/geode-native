*Setting System Properties* describes how to configure Apache Geode native clients and cache servers to participate in a distributed system.

-   **[Configuring the Native Client and Cache Server](config-overview.html)**

    You can configure clients through files and API calls. The servers are configured through command-line input and configuration files.

-   **[Attributes in gfcpp.properties](attributes-gfcpp.html)**

    A variety of `gfcpp.properties` settings can be used when a native client connects to a distributed system.

-   **[gfcpp.properties Example File](../gfcpp.properties/chapter_overview.html)**

    Use the gfcpp.properties file to configure distributed system connections for the Apache Geode native client.
