The security framework authenticates clients as they connect to a <%=vars.product_name%> cache server and authorizes client cache operations. You can also configure it for client authentication of servers, and you can plug in your own implementations for authentication and authorization.

For an explanation of the server-side implementation of security, see [Security](geodeman/managing/security/chapter_overview.html) in the *<%=vars.product_name%> User Guide*.

The following sections describe some client-specific security considerations:

-   **Authentication**

    Geode Native requires providing an authentication implementation.  Examples of these implementations can be found in /templates/security.  Build and link the implementation and set the implementationâ€™s properties on the cache.

-   **[Security-Related System Properties](security-systemprops.html)**

    The table describes the security-related system properties in the `geode.properties` file for native client authentication and authorization.

-   **[SSL Client/Server Communication](sslclientserver.html)**

    This section describes how to configure OpenSSL, implement SSL-based communication between your clients and servers, and run clients and servers with SSL enabled.
