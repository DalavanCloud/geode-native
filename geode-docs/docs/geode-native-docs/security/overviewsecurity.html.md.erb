*Security* describes how to implement the security framework for the Geode native client, including authentication, authorization, ecryption, and SSL client/server communication.

The security framework authenticates clients that attempt to connect to a Geode cache server, and authorizes client cache operations. You can also configure it for client authentication of servers, and you can plug in your own implementations for authentication and authorization.

-   **[Authentication](overviewauthentication.html)**

    A client is authenticated when it connects, with valid credentials, to a Geode cache server that is configured with the client `Authenticator` callback.

-   **[Encrypted Authentication](encrypted-auth.html)**

    You can set up encrypted authentication using Diffe-Hellman or the sample PKCS implementation.

-   **[Client Authorization](overviewclientauthorization.html)**

    Using a provided callback that implements the `AccessControl` interface, you can configure each server to authorize some or all cache operations.

-   **[Security-Related System Properties (gfcpp.properties)](security-systemprops.html)**

    The table describes the security-related system properties in the `gfcpp.properties` file for native client authentication and authorization.

-   **[SSL Client/Server Communication](overviewsslclientserver.html)**

    This section describes how to configure OpenSSL; implement SSL-based communication between your clients and servers; and run clients and servers with SSL enabled.
