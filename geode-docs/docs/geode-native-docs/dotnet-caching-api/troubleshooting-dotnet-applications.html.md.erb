title:  Troubleshooting .NET Applications

The .NET Framework does not find managed DLLs using the conventional `PATH` environment variable. In order for your assembly to find and load a managed DLL, it must either be loaded as a private assembly using `assemblyBinding`, or it must be installed into the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).

The GAC utility must be run on every machine that runs the .NET code.

If an assembly attempts to load the `GemStone.GemFire.Cache.dll` without meeting this requirement, you receive this `System.IO.FileNotFoundException`:

``` pre
{{

Unhandled Exception: System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file
or assembly 'GemStone.GemFire.Cache, Version=8.0.0.0, Culture=neutral,
