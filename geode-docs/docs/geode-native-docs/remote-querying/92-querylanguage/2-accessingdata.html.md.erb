title:  Accessing Cached Data
---

Accessing your cached data through the querying service is similar to accessing database contents through SQL queries. How you specify your regions and region contents is particular to the native client.

The query language supports drilling down into nested object structures. Regions can contain nested data collections that are unavailable until referenced in the FROM clause.

This discussion describes how to navigate to your cached data through the native client query service.

**Note:**
Querying and indexing only operate on remote cache server contents.
